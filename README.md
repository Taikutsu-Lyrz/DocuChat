### Installation & Setup for DocuChat (Python + Streamlit)

To run **DocuChat** locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Open your terminal and clone the project repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Taikutsu-Lyrz/DocuChat.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DocuChat
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   It‚Äôs a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies. Run the following command to create one:

   - For **Windows**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   - For **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

   Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required Python dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the following packages:
   - `langchain==0.0.316`
   - `PyPDF2==3.0.1`
   - `python-dotenv==1.0.1`
   - `streamlit==1.34.0`
   - `openai==0.28.0`
   - `faiss-cpu==1.8.0`
   - `altair==5.3.0`
   - `tiktoken==0.7.0`
   - `youtube_transcript_api==0.6.2`
   - `pillow==10.3.0`
   - `beautifulsoup4==4.12.3`

5. **Run the app:**
   To start the **DocuChat** app using **Streamlit**, run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py  # or whatever the main entry point is
   ```

   This will start the app, and you should be able to access it in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Additional Notes:
- **Make sure you have Python installed** on your system. You can download the latest version from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Set up environment variables:** If needed, create a `.env` file to store your sensitive keys (like OpenAI API keys) in the project directory.
- **Streamlit documentation:** For further customization and usage of Streamlit, you can check the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

With these steps, you‚Äôll be able to run **DocuChat** locally using Python and **Streamlit**.
